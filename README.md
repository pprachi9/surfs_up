# surfs_up

## Project Overview
The motive for this analysis is to analyse the temperature patterns for the months of June and December, so as to evaluate the feasibility of year-round surf shops. The data was obtained after creating two separate queries for June and December each. 
Python, Pandas, SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Flask application were used for this analysis.

## Resources 
Data Sources: hawaii.sqlite

## Results 
- For June, the mean temperature was 75 degF and they were ranging from 64 degF to 85 degF.

## Summary 
The temperatures in December are slightly lower than June but are suitable for a surf shop, but we cannot determine the feasibility of the year-round surf shop from this alone as there are other aspects to weather such as precipitation. We need to perforn nore queries to get additional data so then we can make build a plan on the construction of the surf shop and also aid in the selection of prime locations to attract the customers.
